# abstract-element

## A base class for creating web components with a render function.

AbstractElement uses [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) to render into the DOM
element's. AbstractElement reacts to changes in attributes or states and renders declaratively using the render function.

## Getting started

  1. Add abstract-element to your project:

      ```npm i abstract-element```

  1. Create an element by extending AbstractElement and calling `customElements.define` with your class or use @Define directive if you use TypeScript.

  1. Install the [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML).
